# Eyes

The purpose of this project was to use CSS, HTML, and Javascript to create a set of eyes that would follow the mouse as it moves across the screen.

## Get Started

Download the file and open up the index.html file to view the eyes!

## Future improvements

In the future I would like to work on adding in more animations.
